Use of Hard-Coded Super User Credentials stored outside of the database

To exploit the vulnerability you only need to attempt to login with the default hard-coded credentials which are found in xibo-cms-2.3.10\db\migrations\20180130073838_install_migration.php
'userName' => 'xibo_admin',
                'userPassword' => '5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99',
                
                
This results in Xibo CMS web Application complete compromise
